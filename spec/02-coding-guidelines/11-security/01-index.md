## Purpose

Central location for all **security-related coding guidelines**, policies, and advisory documentation. This module covers dependency security, version pinning policies, vulnerability tracking, and secure coding practices.

Any security discussion, advisory, or policy that affects how code is written or dependencies are managed belongs here.

| # | Subfolder | Description | Files |

## When to Add Content Here

Add a new subfolder under `11-security/` when:

- A **dependency security vulnerability** is discovered and requires a pinning policy
- A **secure coding pattern** needs to be documented (e.g., input sanitization, auth token handling)
- A **supply chain security** concern arises (e.g., compromised packages)
- A **security audit** produces findings that should be codified as rules

### Subfolder Template

```
11-security/
└── NN-{topic-name}/
    ├── 01-index.md              ← Policy summary, version matrix
    ├── 01-implementation-rules.md  ← How to enforce the policy
    ├── 02-security-notes.md        ← Detailed advisory, audit trail
    └── 99-consistency-report.md    ← Health check
```
